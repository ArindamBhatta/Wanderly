# options for generated firebase with flutterfire
1. firebase login
--> check currently login or not
2. flutter pub global activate flutterfire_cli
--> Install packages

3. flutterfire configure
--> config the platforms. default every one is selected but use space for unselect the items => generate app Id by default.

4.firebase_core
--> it acts as the foundation for connecting your Flutter app to your Firebase project

5. cloud_firestore
-->  interact with Google Cloud Firestore, e.g:- QuerySnapshot, CollectionReference


Note 1. Think very clear way what you want to do modification in name prone to error if name change then change google-service.json
